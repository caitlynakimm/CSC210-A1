Reflection on your experience with this assignment:
- I found this assignment to be very complex and challenging. Implementing the methods in the DynamicArray class took a lot of work and I took a lot of time thinking carefully about conceptually how I would add, append, remove, split, delete, and extract elements/arrays and also what the starting and ending conditions would be in the for loops I created in my group 2 and 3 methods. Creating the unit tests also took a long time as I had to think of so many different ways someone could test or try to break the methods. This assignment was very demanding, but it also helped me better visualize how arraylists work to allocate memory and make various changes quickly. I am now even more thankful for arraylists.
